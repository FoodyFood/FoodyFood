# FoodyFood's GitHub

I like to build stuff and things, mostly on a whim or to see if something is possible, usually based around enabling my lazyness, or things that make my life easier. I also make examples I can use to demonstrate things in work or to help get a concept or idea across.

I like to dabble in a few languages, but my favourite used to be C/C++ back when I worked with micros more. It will always have my heart, but python seems to be where the industry is so I use it more than anything else these days, but I suppose all those repos are in work so it get's very little representation here :)
